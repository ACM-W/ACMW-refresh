          Our club was born in Fall 2015. Kathy Saad- the first President and Michael Shafae - the first advisor, were the founders of our club. Ever since it has continued to grow with more members joining and events becoming more successful.</p>
          <p>Our purpose is to reach out to local communities with a focus on a younger female audience, and teach them the exciting world of computer science. We do this by teaching them fundamental concepts of computer programming by providing them with interactive experiences. Ozobots are a great device we use to teach young girls how to code. As they require minimal setup and give the conceptial ideas of how to program an object. We do reach out to older crowds with a higher level of thirst for knowledge. Raspberry Pi's are a great way to show them the possibilites as it is a very versatile piece of equipment. Through our interaction with students, projects were made, knowledge was gained, and friendships were formed.</p>
          <p>We engage with our local community by hosting events and inviting interested members. The events are described below.</p>

                <h1>Creative Coding</h1>
                <p>Creative Coding is a program designed by ACM and ACM-W members at California State University, Fullerton. The purpose is to introduce to girl scouts the many ways computer science can be applied to different devices. We've shown girl scouts how to write and understand code in various programming languages by utilizing Ozobots, Turtle Graphics, Google Cardboards, and Raspberry Pi's. Our objective is to get girl scouts more enthusiastic about STEM, especially Computer Science.</p>

                <h1>Stem Expo</h1>
                <p>We've teamed up with the Girls Scouts of Orange County and on October 30, 2016 they bring over 400 girls scouts ranging from 4th to 12th grade to the Fullerton campus. The event is designed to show them the great opportunities that the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics field can offer for their lives and future. We have another STEM Expo event coming up this year on October 15, 2017. </p>

                <h1>Leadership and Diversity Summit</h1>
                <p>This summit was hosted by both ACM &amp; ACMW. In this event, CSUF students were able to gather insightful information about what to expect when working in the technical industry. Professionals directly spoke to students to share their experience and provide useful tips that students can take with them in their pursuit of their career.</p>

                <p>This event was designed to give both local students from high schools and CSUF students at any level new computer skills to learn. We held multiple workshops that each discussed a different application for programming languages. Some students were able to learn the building blocks on how to build a game through Unity, understand cloud systems and devices, and physical application on circuit boards.</p>
