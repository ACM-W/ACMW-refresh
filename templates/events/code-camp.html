            <p>This event was designed to give both local students from high schools and CSUF students at any level new computer skills to learn. We held multiple workshops that each discussed a different application for programming languages. Some students were able to learn the building blocks on how to build a game through Unity, understand cloud systems and devices, and physical application on circuit boards. </p>
